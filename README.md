Abstract 1:
This idea is to develop a mobile dashboard to control household IoT devices. Since recently years, the idea of “smart home” become more and more popular, We are trying to use Raspberry Pi to prototype this goal. First connect a Wi-Fi adapter or Ethernet cable to Raspberry Pi to make sure it have internet access. Second, connect couple LEDs with it, in this case these LEDs will be controlled by Raspberry Pi . Then we will develop a mobile dashboard (mobile app or web app) to control LEDs’ on or off via sending request through server (online server or Raspberry Pi itself) to reach Raspberry Pi at the end which have final control with LEDs. So the process basically is “mobile dashboard” -> “server” -> “Raspberry Pi” -> “LEDs”. Abstract of sample IoT network.

Abstract 2:
#5 Digital loyalty program app for small businesses
80% of small businesses (specially mom & pop) can not afford to have sophisticated program to collect customer data and make them return to their businesses repeatedly. This app allows coffee shops, local grocery vendors, barbers and hair salons to create a digital loyalty program for their visitors and customers. 

Implementation: Establish a mobile application for small and medium business to create their loyalty membership program running on mobile web app. Using API or XML to grab data from database or data center, using R to analysis data and presenting the result to front-end web app, using JQuery or JavaScript. This mobile web app is focus on keep every customer of venders stay close to their business and run the marketing automatically for venders.
